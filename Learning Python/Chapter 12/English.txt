World War II
World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also
known as the Second World War, was a global war that
lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's
countries—including all the great powers—eventually formed
two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. A state
of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million
people from more than 30 countries. The major participants
threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific
capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction
between civilian and military resources. World War II was the
deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 70 to 85 million
fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and
China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust,
strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and
disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.
Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at
war with China by 1937, [b] though neither side had declared
war on the other. World War II is generally said to have begun
on 1 September 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany
and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and
the United Kingdom. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series
of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled
much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with
Italy and Japan. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of
August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and
annexed territories of their European neighbours, Poland,
Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. Following the onset of
campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the Fall of
France in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the
European Axis powers and the British Empire. War in the
Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz, and the long
Battle of the Atlantic followed. On 22 June 1941, the European
Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening
the largest land theatre of war in history. This Eastern Front
trapped the Axis, most crucially the German Wehrmacht, in a
war of attrition. In December 1941, Japan launched a surprise
attack on the United States as well as European colonies in the
Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against

Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis
powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of
the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the
support of several armies from defeated territories.
The Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy
were defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which
included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, and Allied victories in
the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies
invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany
and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia, in Central China, South
China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands.
The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in
the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May
1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its
terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August
respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings,
the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its intention to surrender
on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and war crimes
trials were conducted in the wake of the war both against the Germans and against the Japanese.
World War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations (UN) was
established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious great powers—China,
France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the permanent members of its Security
Council. The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-
century long Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the
decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic
recovery and expansion. Political integration, especially in Europe, emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and
create a common identity.

The start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939, [2][3] beginning with the German invasion of
Poland; the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany two days later. The dates for the beginning of war
in the Pacific include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937, [4][5] or even the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria on 19 September 1931. [6][7]
Others follow the British historian A.J.P. Taylor, who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its
colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other
starting dates sometimes used for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935. [8] The
British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between
Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939. [9]
The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war
ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan, which was on 2
September 1945 that officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty with Japan was signed in 1951. [10] A treaty
regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved
most post-World War II issues. [11] No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed. [12]

World War I had radically altered the political European map, with the defeat of the Central Powers—including
Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia,
which eventually led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as
France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of
Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian Empires.
To prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was created during
the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals were to
prevent armed conflict through collective security, military and naval
disarmament, and settling international disputes through peaceful
negotiations and arbitration.
Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I, [13] its aftermath still
caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states.
These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the
significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty
of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home
territory and all its overseas possessions, while German annexation of other
states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's
armed forces. [14]
The German Empire was dissolved in the German Revolution of 1918–1919, and a democratic government, later known
as the Weimar Republic, was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and
hardline opponents on both the right and left. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains;
however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian
entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist movement led by
Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished
representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist
foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a "New Roman Empire". [15]
Adolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923, eventually became the
Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world
order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. [16] Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, allowed Italy a
free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the
Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles,
accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription. [17]
The United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step
towards military globalisation; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with
Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern
Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the Franco-Soviet pact was
required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless. [18] The
United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year. [19]
Hitler defied the Versailles and Locarno treaties by remilitarising the Rhineland in March 1936, encountering little
opposition due to appeasement. [20] In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the Rome–Berlin Axis. A month later,
Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy would join in the following year. [21]

The Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign against
regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon
embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies [22] and
new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which
had long sought influence in China [23] as the first step of what its government saw
as the country's right to rule Asia, staged the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch
an invasion of Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo. [24]
China appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for
its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in
Shanghai, Rehe and Hebei, until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933. Thereafter,
Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in
Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan. [25] After the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the
Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to
oppose Japan. [26]
The Second Italo–Ethiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in
October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of
the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of the
Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia), which was launched from Italian
Somaliland and Eritrea. [27] The war resulted in the military occupation of
Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East
Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI); in addition it exposed the
weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy
and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did little when the
former clearly violated Article X of the League's Covenant. [28] The United
Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the
invasion, but they were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian
invasion. [29] Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing Austria. [30]
When civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the Nationalist rebels, led by General
Francisco Franco. Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis did: altogether Mussolini sent to
Spain more than 70,000 ground troops and 6,000 aviation personnel, as well as about 720 aircraft. [31] The Soviet
Union supported the existing government, the Spanish Republic. More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the

International Brigades, also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany
and the Soviet Union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in
combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the
civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral
during World War II but generally favoured the Axis. [32] His greatest
collaboration with Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the
Eastern Front. [33]
In July 1937, Japan captured
the former Chinese imperial
capital of Peking after
instigating the Marco Polo
Bridge Incident, which
culminated in the Japanese
campaign to invade all of China. [34] The Soviets quickly signed a non-
aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending
China's prior co-operation with Germany. From September to November,
the Japanese attacked Taiyuan, engaged the Kuomintang Army around
Xinkou, [35] and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan. [36][37]
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but, after three months of fighting,
Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December
1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed
combatants were murdered by the Japanese. [38][39]
In March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at Taierzhuang but then the city of Xuzhou was
taken by Japanese in May. [40] In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River;
this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the city was taken by October. [41]
Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve;
instead the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war. [42][43]
In the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic
border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Japanese doctrine
of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was
favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. With the Japanese defeat
at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War [44] and ally
Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove
difficult to maintain. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a
Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-
ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward, eventually
leading to its war with the United States and the Western Allies. [45][46]
The bombing of Guernica in 1937,
during the Spanish Civil War,
sparked fears abroad in Europe that
the next war would be based on
bombing of cities with very high
civilian casualties.

In Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March
1938, Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other
European powers. [47] Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on
the Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic
German population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the
counsel of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this
territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against
the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of
no further territorial demands. [48] Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy
forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary, and Poland
annexed Czechoslovakia's Zaolzie region. [49]
Although all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the
agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia
in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish "war-mongers" and in January 1939
secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, Germany
invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and
Moravia and a pro-German client state, the Slovak Republic. [50] Hitler also delivered 20 March 1939 ultimatum to
Lithuania, forcing the concession of the Klaipeda Region. [51]
Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of
Danzig, the United Kingdom and France guaranteed their support for Polish
independence; when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939, the same guarantee was
extended to Romania and Greece. [52] Shortly after the Franco-British pledge to
Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel. [53]
Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to "encircle" Germany and
renounced the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish Non-
Aggression Pact. [54]
The situation reached a general crisis in late August as German troops continued to
mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August, when tripartite negotiations
about a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom and Soviet Union
stalled, [55] the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany. [56] This
pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet "spheres of influence"
(western Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia,
Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing
Polish independence. [57] The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to
a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the
prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I. Immediately after that, Hitler
ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United
Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland, and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he
decided to delay it. [58]
In response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which only
served as a pretext to worsen relations. [59] On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish plenipotentiary immediately

travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of Danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor in which the
German minority would vote on secession. [59] The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the
night of 30–31 August in a stormy meeting with the British ambassador Neville Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that
Germany considered its claims rejected. [60]
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland after having staged several
false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the attack. [61] The Battle of
Westerplatte is often described as the first battle of the war. [62] The United
Kingdom responded with an ultimatum to Germany to cease military
operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, France
and Britain, along with their empires, declared war on Germany. As part of
this, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada also joined the war.
The alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a
cautious French probe into the Saarland. [63] The Western Allies also began
a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's
economy and war effort. [64] Germany responded by ordering U-boat
warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate
into the Battle of the Atlantic. [65]
On 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw. The Polish
counter offensive to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was
outflanked and encircled by the Wehrmacht. Remnants of the Polish army broke
through to besieged Warsaw. On 17 September 1939, after signing a cease-fire with
Japan, the Soviets invaded Eastern Poland [66] under a pretext that the Polish state
had ostensibly ceased to exist. [67] On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison
surrendered to the Germans, and the last large operational unit of the Polish Army
surrendered on 6 October. Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered;
instead it formed the Polish government-in-exile and a clandestine state apparatus
remained in occupied Poland. [68] A significant part of Polish military personnel
evacuated to Romania and the Baltic countries; many of them would fight against
the Axis in other theatres of the war. [69]
Germany annexed the western and occupied the central part of Poland, and the
Soviet Union annexed its eastern part; small shares of Polish territory were
transferred to Lithuania and Slovakia. On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace
overture to the United Kingdom and France, but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by
Germany and the Soviet Union. The proposal was rejected, [60] and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against
France, [70] which would be postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather. [71][72][73]
The Soviet Union forced the Baltic countries—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the states that were in the Soviet "sphere
of influence" under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact—to sign "mutual assistance pacts" that stipulated stationing Soviet

troops in these countries. Soon after, significant Soviet military contingents
were moved there. [74][75][76] Finland refused to sign a similar pact and
rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union
invaded Finland in November 1939, [77] and the Soviet Union was expelled
from the League of Nations. [78] Despite overwhelming numerical
superiority, Soviet military success was modest, and the Finno-Soviet war
ended in March 1940 with minimal Finnish concessions. [79]
In June 1940, the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, [75] and the disputed Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern
Bukovina and Hertza. Meanwhile, Nazi-Soviet political rapprochement and
economic co-operation [80][81] gradually stalled, [82][83] and both states
began preparations for war. [84]
In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to
protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies
were attempting to cut off. [85] Denmark capitulated after a
few hours, and Norway was conquered within two
months [86] despite Allied support. British discontent over
the Norwegian campaign led to the appointment of Winston
Churchill as Prime Minister on 10 May 1940. [87]
On the same day, Germany launched an offensive against
France. To circumvent the strong Maginot Line
fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany
directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Luxembourg. [88] The Germans carried out
a flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region, [89]
which was mistakenly perceived by Allies as an
impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.
[90][91] By successfully implementing new blitzkrieg tactics,
the Wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the
Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille. The United Kingdom was able to evacuate a
significant number of Allied troops from the continent by early June, although abandoning almost all their
equipment. [92]
On 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom. [93] The Germans turned
south against the weakened French army, and Paris fell to them on 14 June. Eight days later France signed an
armistice with Germany; it was divided into German and Italian occupation zones, [94] and an unoccupied rump state
under the Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet,
which the United Kingdom attacked on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany. [95]
The Battle of Britain [96] began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours. [97] The United Kingdom
rejected Hitler's ultimatum, [98] and the German air superiority campaign started in August but failed to defeat RAF

Fighter Command. Due to this the proposed German invasion of Britain
was postponed indefinitely on 17 September. The German strategic
bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on London and other cities
in the Blitz, but failed to significantly disrupt the British war effort [97] and
largely ended in May 1941. [99]
Using newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success
against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British
shipping in the Atlantic. [100] The British Home Fleet scored a significant
victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship Bismarck. [101]
In November 1939, the United States was taking measures to assist China
and the Western Allies, and amended the Neutrality Act to allow "cash and
carry" purchases by the Allies. [102] In 1940, following the German capture
of Paris, the size of the United States Navy was significantly increased. In September the United States further agreed
to a trade of American destroyers for British bases. [103] Still, a large majority of the American public continued to
oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941. [104] In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler
of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an
"arsenal of democracy" and promoting Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort. [98] The United
States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany. [105]
At the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy and Germany as the Axis Powers. The
Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power
would be forced to go to war against all three. [106] The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and
Romania joined. [107] Romania and Hungary would make major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union,
in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union. [108]
In early June 1940 the Italian Regia aeronautica attacked and besieged
Malta, a British possession. In late summer through early autumn Italy
conquered British Somaliland and made an incursion into British-held
Egypt. In October Italy attacked Greece, but the attack was repulsed with
heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within days with minor
territorial changes. [109] Germany started preparation for an invasion of the
Balkans to assist Italy, to prevent the British from gaining a foothold there,
which would be a potential threat for Romanian oil fields, and to strike
against the British dominance of the Mediterranean. [110]
In December 1940, British Empire forces began counter-offensives against
Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa. [111] The offensives were
highly successful; by early February 1941 Italy had lost control of eastern
Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The
Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting
three Italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at Taranto and neutralising several more warships at the
Battle of Cape Matapan. [112]

Italian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to
North Africa, and at the end of March 1941 Rommel's Afrika Korps
launched an offensive which drove back the Commonwealth forces. [113] In
under a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and besieged the
port of Tobruk. [114]
By late March 1941 Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact;
however, the Yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by pro-
British nationalists. Germany responded with simultaneous invasions of
both Yugoslavia and Greece, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations
were forced to surrender within the month. [115] The airborne invasion of
the Greek island of Crete at the end of May completed the German conquest
of the Balkans. [116] Although the Axis victory was swift, bitter and large-scale partisan warfare subsequently broke out
against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war. [117]
In the Middle East, in May Commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German
aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria. [118] Between June and July they invaded and occupied the French
possessions Syria and Lebanon, with the assistance of the Free French. [119]
With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany,
Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets
wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning
to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich
European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the
Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. [120] By contrast, the
Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the
Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border. [121]
Hitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was
based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would
enter the war against Germany sooner or later. [122] He therefore
decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or
failing that to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November
1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would
join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked
for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that
Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler
issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet
Union. [123]
On 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with
Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. [124] The
primary targets of this surprise offensive [125] were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of
ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives

were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate
Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") [126] by dispossessing
the native population [127] and guarantee access to the strategic resources
needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals. [128]
Although the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives
before the war, [129] Barbarossa forced the Soviet supreme command to
adopt a strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made significant
gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and
materiel. By mid-August, however, the German Army High Command
decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group
Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing
towards central Ukraine and Leningrad. [130] The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in
encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially
developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov). [131]
The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their
air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern
Front [132] prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its grand
strategy. [133] In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military
alliance against Germany [134] The British and Soviets invaded neutral Iran
to secure the Persian Corridor and Iran's oil fields. [135] In August, the
United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic
Charter. [136]
By October Axis operational objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region
were achieved, with only the sieges of Leningrad [137] and Sevastopol
continuing. [138] A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two
months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army
almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops [139] were forced to suspend their
offensive. [140] Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main
objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union
retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase of the war in Europe had ended. [141]
By early December, freshly mobilised reserves [142] allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis
troops. [143] This, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East
would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army, [144] allowed the Soviets to begin a massive
counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100–250 kilometres
(62–155 mi) west. [145]
In 1939, the United States had renounced its trade treaty with Japan, and beginning with an aviation gasoline ban in
July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing economic pressure. [98] During this time, Japan launched its first attack
against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September. [146] Despite several
offensives by both sides, the war between China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by

blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan
invaded and occupied northern Indochina. [147] Afterwards, the United States embargoed iron, steel and mechanical
parts against Japan. [148]
Chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940. In August, Chinese communists
launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce
human and material resources for the communists. [149] Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and
nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation. [150] In March,
the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during Battle of
Shanggao. [151] In September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist
forces. [152]
German successes in Europe encouraged Japan to increase pressure on
European governments in Southeast Asia. The Dutch government agreed to
provide Japan some oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but
negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June
1941. [153] In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus
threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United
States, United Kingdom and other Western governments reacted to this
move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo. [154][155] At
the same time, Japan was planning an invasion of the Soviet Far East,
intending to capitalise off the German invasion in the west, but abandoned
the operation after the sanctions. [156]
Since early 1941 the United States and Japan had been engaged in
negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the
war in China. During these negotiations Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the
Americans as inadequate. [157] At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged
in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them. [158]
Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned
Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any "neighboring countries". [158]
Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American-
British-Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. On 20 November a new
government under Hideki Tojo presented an interim proposal as its final
offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the
embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange,
Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to
withdraw its forces from southern Indochina. [157] The American counter-
proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without
conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers. [159]
That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its
ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch
East Indies by force; [160][161] the Japanese military did not consider the
former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an
unspoken declaration of war. [162]

Japan planned to rapidly seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the
Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-
stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war. [163][164] To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it
was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines
from the outset. [165] On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American
holdings with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific. [166] These included an
attack on the American fleets at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, landings in Thailand and Malaya, [166] and the Battle
of Hong Kong. [167]
These attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia and several other states to formally declare war
on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries,
maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan. [168] Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the
United States [169] in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had
been ordered by Roosevelt. [124][170]
On 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four [171] —the Soviet Union, China, the
United Kingdom and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments
issued the Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming the Atlantic
Charter, [172] and agreeing to not to sign a separate peace with the Axis
powers. [173]
During 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to
pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective. The
Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through
France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the
other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to
wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster
resistance forces. Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing
campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by
Allied armour without using large-scale armies. [174] Eventually, the British
persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and
they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa. [175]
At the Casablanca Conference in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration, and
demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the
initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes. [176] Although the
British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted
a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to
invade France in 1944. [177]
By the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally Thailand had almost fully conquered Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East
Indies, Singapore, and Rabaul, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners. [178]

Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces, the
Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May
1942, forcing its government into exile. [179] On 16 April, in
Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the
Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung
and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division. [180] Japanese
forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea,
Java Sea and Indian Ocean, [181] and bombed the Allied
naval base at Darwin, Australia. In January 1942, the only
Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at
Changsha. [182] These easy victories over unprepared US and
European opponents left Japan overconfident, as well as
overextended. [183]
In early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to capture
Port Moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever
communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when
an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the
Coral Sea. [184] Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American
carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in
Alaska. [185] In mid-May, Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution
on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying air bases and fighting
against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups. [186][187] In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the
Americans, having broken Japanese naval codes in late May, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used
this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy. [188]
With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the
Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port
Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua. [189] The
Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the
southern Solomon Islands, primarily Guadalcanal, as a first step towards
capturing Rabaul, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia. [190]
Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, the Battle for
Guadalcanal took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were
ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the northern part of the
island, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of
Buna-Gona. [191] Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with
heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By
the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew
their troops. [192] In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, an offensive into the Arakan
region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943. [193] The second was the insertion of
irregular forces behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results. [194]

Despite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and
its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and
southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had
achieved during the previous year. [195] In May the
Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch
Peninsula and at Kharkov, [196] and then launched their
main summer offensive against southern Russia in June
1942, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy
Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the
northern and central areas of the front. The Germans
split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the
Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad
on the Volga. [197]
By mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting. The Soviets began their second
winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad, [198] and an assault on the
Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. [199] By early February 1943, the German Army had
taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated, [200] and the front-line had been pushed
back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the
Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk. [201]
Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy
ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast. [202] By November
1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, Operation
Crusader, in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and
Italians had made. [203] In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive
in January, pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala Line by early
February, [204] followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used
to prepare for their upcoming offensives. [205] Concerns the Japanese might
use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island
in early May 1942. [206] An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat
deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein. [207] On the
Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in
the disastrous Dieppe Raid, [208] demonstrated the Western Allies' inability
to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better
preparation, equipment, and operational security. [209]
In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein [210] and, at a high cost, managed
to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta. [211] A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack
of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya. [212] This attack was followed
up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, which resulted in the region joining the Allies. [213]
Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France; [213] although Vichy
forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German
forces. [213][214] The Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May

1943. [213][215]
In June 1943 the British and Americans began a strategic bombing campaign against Germany with a goal to disrupt
the war economy, reduce morale, and "de-house" the civilian population. [216] The firebombing of Hamburg was among
the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this
important industrial centre. [217]
After the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Allies initiated several operations
against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and US forces were
sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians. [218] Soon after, the
United States, with support from Australian and New Zealand forces, began
major operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and
breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall
Islands. [219] By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of
these objectives, and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk
in the Caroline Islands. In April, the Allies launched an operation to retake
Western New Guinea. [220]
In the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and
early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central Russia. On 4
July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within
a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets'
deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences, [221] and for the first time in the war Hitler cancelled the operation
before it had achieved tactical or operational success. [222] This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies'
invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest
of Mussolini later that month. [223]
On 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby
dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The
Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority, [224] giving
the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front. [225][226] The Germans
tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–
Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower
Dnieper Offensives. [227]
On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland,
following Italy's armistice with the Allies. [228] Germany with the help of
fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places
without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, [229] and creating a series of defensive lines. [230]
German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy
named the Italian Social Republic, [231] causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought through several lines
until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November. [232]
German operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly

effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval
campaign. [233] In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo
and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran. [234] The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese
territory [235] and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, [236] while the latter included agreement that the
Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three
months of Germany's defeat. [237]
From November 1943, during the seven-week Battle of Changde, the
Chinese forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition, while awaiting Allied
relief. [238][239][240] In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks
in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with
landings at Anzio. [241]
On 27 January 1944, Soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled
German forces from the Leningrad region, thereby ending the most lethal
siege in history. [242] The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-
war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians
hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed
subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. [243] By late May
1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from
Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the
Axis troops. [244] The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the
expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June Rome was captured. [245]
The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an
operation against British positions in Assam, India, [246] and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and
Kohima. [247] In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by
July, [247] and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in
Myitkyina. [248] The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways
between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields. [249] By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of
Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha in Hunan province. [250]
On 6 June 1944 (known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet pressure, [251]
the Western Allies invaded northern France. After reassigning several
Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France. [252] These
landings were successful, and led to the defeat of the German Army units in
France. Paris was liberated on 25 August by the local resistance assisted by
the Free French Forces, both led by General Charles de Gaulle, [253] and the
Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe
during the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern
Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands
failed. [254] After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but
failed to cross the Ruhr river in a large offensive. In Italy, Allied advance
also slowed due to the last major German defensive line. [255]

On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus
("Operation Bagration") that destroyed the German Army Group Centre
almost completely. [256] Soon after that, another Soviet strategic offensive
forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The
Soviets formed the Polish Committee of National Liberation to control
territory in Poland and combat the Polish Armia Krajowa; The Soviet Red
Army remained in the Praga district on the other side of the Vistula and
watched passively as the Germans quelled the Warsaw Uprising initiated by
the Armia Krajowa. [257] The national uprising in Slovakia was also quelled
by the Germans. The Soviet Red Army's strategic offensive in eastern
Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and
triggered a successful coup d'état in Romania and in Bulgaria, followed by
those countries' shift to the Allied side. [258]
In September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups
E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off. [259] By this point, the Communist-led
Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the
occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German
forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Soviet Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the
Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a
massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945. [260] Unlike
impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus
denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, [261]
although Finland was forced to fight their former ally Germany. [262]
By the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had
repelled the Japanese sieges in Assam, pushing the Japanese back to the
Chindwin River [263] while the Chinese captured Myitkyina. In September
1944, Chinese forces captured Mount Song and reopened the Burma
Road. [264] In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally
captured Changsha in mid-June and the city of Hengyang by early
August. [265] Soon after, they invaded the province of Guangxi, winning
major engagements against Chinese forces at Guilin and Liuzhou by the
end of November [266] and successfully linking up their forces in China and
Indochina by mid-December. [267]
In the Pacific, US forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In
mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau
islands, and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. These defeats led to the resignation
of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy
bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte;
soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in
history. [268]

On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt on the Western Front
by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-
offensive in the Ardennes and along the French–German border to split the
Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture
their primary supply port at Antwerp to prompt a political settlement. [269]
By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives
fulfilled. [269] In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the
German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles
attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany,
and overran East Prussia. [270] On 4 February Soviet, British and US leaders
met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war
Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against
Japan. [271]
In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western
Allies entered western Germany and closed to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north
and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B. [272] In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil
reserves in Hungary and to retake Budapest, Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake
Balaton. In two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to Vienna, and captured the city. In early
April, Soviet troops captured Königsberg, while the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across
western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April,
leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin.
Soviet and Polish forces stormed and captured Berlin in late April. In Italy,
German forces surrendered on 29 April. On 30 April, the Reichstag was
captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany, [273] Berlin
garrison surrendered on 2 May.
Several changes in leadership occurred during this period. On 12 April,
President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by Harry S. Truman. Benito
Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April. [274] Two days later,
Hitler committed suicide in besieged Berlin, and he was succeeded by
Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz. [275]
Total and unconditional
surrender in Europe was signed
on 7 and 8 May, to be effective
by the end of 8 May. [276]

In the Pacific theatre, American forces accompanied by the forces of the

recaptured Manila in March. Fighting continued on Luzon, Mindanao, and

other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war. [278] Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Forces launched a
massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry and civilian
morale. A devastating bombing raid on Tokyo of 9–10 March was the deadliest conventional bombing raid in
history. [279]
In May 1945, Australian troops landed in Borneo, over-running the oilfields
there. British, American, and Chinese forces defeated the Japanese in
northern Burma in March, and the British pushed on to reach Rangoon by
3 May. [280] Chinese forces started a counterattack in the Battle of West
Hunan that occurred between 6 April and 7 June 1945. American naval and
amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March,
and Okinawa by the end of June. [281] At the same time, American
submarines cut off Japanese imports, drastically reducing Japan's ability to
supply its overseas forces. [282]
On 11 July, Allied leaders met in Potsdam, Germany. They confirmed
earlier agreements about Germany, [283] and the American, British and
Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of
Japan, specifically stating that "the alternative for Japan is prompt and
utter destruction". [284] During this conference, the United Kingdom held
its general election, and Clement Attlee replaced Churchill as Prime
Minister. [285]
The call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the Japanese government, which believed it would be capable of
negotiating for more favourable surrender terms. [286] In early August, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the
Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement,
invaded Japanese-held Manchuria and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting
force, [287] thereby persuading previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms. [288] The Red
Army also captured the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered,
with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay on the deck of the American battleship USS Missouri on 2
September 1945, ending the war. [289]
The Allies established occupation administrations in Austria and
Germany. The former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any
political bloc. The latter was divided into western and eastern
occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet
Union. A denazification programme in Germany led to the
prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the Nuremberg trials and the
removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards
amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German
society. [290]
Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the
eastern territories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were

taken over by Poland, [291] and East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the
expulsion to Germany of the nine million Germans from these provinces, [292][293] as well as three million Germans
from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The
Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line, [294] from which 2 million Poles were expelled;
[293][295] north-east Romania, [296][297] parts of eastern Finland, [298] and the three Baltic states were incorporated into
the Soviet Union. [299][300]
In an effort to maintain world peace, [301] the Allies formed the United
Nations, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, [302] and
adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common
standard for all member nations. [303] The great powers that were the
victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union
and the United States—became the permanent members of the UN's
Security Council. [304] The five permanent members remain so to the
present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic
of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet
Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the
dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The alliance between the Western
Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war
was over. [305]
Germany had been de facto divided,
and two independent states, the
Federal Republic of Germany and the
German Democratic Republic, [306] were created within the borders of Allied and
Soviet occupation zones. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and
Soviet spheres of influence. [307] Most eastern and central European countries fell
into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with
full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East
Germany, [308] Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania [309]
became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully
independent policy, causing tension with the Soviet Union. [310]
Post-war division of the world was formalised by two international military
alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. [311] The
long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the Cold
War, would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy wars. [312]
In Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administrated Japan's
former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed Sakhalin and the
Kuril Islands. [313] Korea, formerly under Japanese rule, was divided and occupied
by the Soviet Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics
emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea,
which led ultimately to the Korean War. [314]
In China, nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and

established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while
nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. [315] In the Middle East, the
Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the
creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab–Israeli conflict. While
European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires,
their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this
unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation. [316][317]
The global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating
nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer
than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross
domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other
powers, and it dominated the world economy. [318] The UK and US pursued
a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany in the years
1945–1948. [319] Because of international trade interdependencies this led to European economic stagnation and
delayed European recovery for several years. [320][321]
Recovery began with the mid-1948 currency reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of
European economic policy that the Marshall Plan (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused. [322][323] The
post-1948 West German recovery has been called the German economic miracle. [324] Italy also experienced an
economic boom [325] and the French economy rebounded. [326] By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of
economic ruin, [327] and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other
European country, [328] it continued in relative economic decline for decades. [329]
The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the
immediate post-war era. [330] Japan experienced incredibly rapid economic growth, becoming one of the most powerful
economies in the world by the 1980s. [331] China returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952. [332]
Estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. [333] Most suggest
that some 60 million people died in the war, including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians.
[334][335][336] Many of the civilians died because of deliberate genocide, massacres, mass-bombings, disease, and
starvation.
The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war, [337] 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian
deaths. [338] A quarter of the people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed. [339] Germany sustained 5.3 million
military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany. [340]
Of the total number of deaths in World War II, approximately 85 per cent—mostly Soviet and Chinese—were on the
Allied side. [341] Many of these deaths were caused by war crimes committed by German and Japanese forces in
occupied territories. An estimated 11 [342] to 17 million [343] civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of Nazi
racist policies, including mass killing of around 6 million Jews, along with Roma, homosexuals, at least 1.9 million
ethnic Poles [344][345] and millions of other Slavs (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), and other ethnic

and minority groups. [346][343] Between 1941
and 1945, more than 200,000 ethnic Serbs,
along with gypsies and Jews, were
persecuted and murdered by the Axis-
aligned Croatian Ustaše in Yugoslavia. [347]
Also, more than 100,000 Poles were
massacred by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army
in the Volhynia massacres, between 1943
and 1945. [348] At the same time about
10,000–15,000 Ukrainians were killed by
the Polish Home Army and other Polish
units, in reprisal attacks. [349]
In Asia and the Pacific, between 3 million and more than 10 million
civilians, mostly Chinese (estimated at 7.5 million [350] ), were killed by the
Japanese occupation forces. [351] The most infamous Japanese atrocity was
the Nanking Massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese
civilians were raped and murdered. [352] Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that
2.7 million casualties occurred during the Sanko Sakusen. General Yasuji
Okamura implemented the policy in Heipei and Shantung. [353]
Axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. The Imperial
Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and
occupation of China (see Unit 731) [354][355] and in early conflicts against
the Soviets. [356] Both the Germans and the Japanese tested such weapons
against civilians, [357] and sometimes on prisoners of war. [358]
The Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish officers, [359] and the imprisonment or
execution of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD, along with mass civilian deportations to Siberia, in the
Baltic states and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army. [360]
The mass-bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a war crime, although no positive or specific
customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during World War II. [361]
The USAAF firebombed a total of 67 Japanese cities, killing 393,000 civilians and destroying 65% of built-up
areas. [362]
Nazi Germany was responsible for the Holocaust (killing approximately 6 million Jews), as well as for killing 2.7
million ethnic Poles [363] and 4 million others who were deemed "unworthy of life" (including the disabled and mentally
ill, Soviet prisoners of war, Romani, homosexuals, Freemasons, and Jehovah's Witnesses) as part of a programme of
deliberate extermination, in effect becoming a "genocidal state". [364] Soviet POWs were kept in especially unbearable
conditions, and 3.6 million Soviet POWs out of 5.7 died in Nazi camps during the war. [365][366] In addition to
concentration camps, death camps were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people at an industrial scale. Nazi

Germany extensively used forced labourers; about 12 million Europeans
from German occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work
force in German industry, agriculture and war economy. [367]
The Soviet Gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during
1942–43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of
inmates, [368] including foreign citizens of Poland and other countries
occupied in 1939–40 by the Soviet Union, as well as Axis POWs. [369] By the
end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many
repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they
were subjected to NKVD evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as
real or perceived Nazi collaborators. [370]
Japanese prisoner-of-war
camps, many of which were
used as labour camps, also had
high death rates. The
International Military Tribunal
for the Far East found the death
rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 per cent (for American POWs, 37 per
cent), [371] seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. [372]
While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and
14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan,
the number of Chinese released was only 56. [373]
At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo
were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board,
or Koain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. [374] In Java, between 4 and
10 million romusha (Japanese: "manual labourers"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of
these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated
to Java. [375]
In Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and
Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the
annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic
policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichmarks (27.8
billion US dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the
sizeable plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials
and other goods. [376] Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40
per cent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which
increased to nearly 40 per cent of total German income as the war went
on. [377]

fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources
to the German invaders. [378] Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy
encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the "inferior
people" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by
mass executions. [379] Although resistance groups formed in most occupied
territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either
the East [380] or the West [381] until late 1943.
In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony
which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples. [382]
Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from
European domination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned
local public opinion against them within weeks. [383] During Japan's initial
conquest it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m 3 ) of oil (~5.5×10 5
tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get
production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (~6.8 ×10 6 t), 76 per cent of its 1940 output rate. [383]
In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had
significant advantages in both population and
economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United
Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a
30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher
gross domestic product than the European Axis powers
(Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then
gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population
and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP. [384] In Asia at the
same time, China had roughly six times the population of
Japan, but only an 89 per cent higher GDP; this is
reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per
cent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included. [384]
The United States provided about two-thirds of all the
ordnance used by the Allies in terms of warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition. [385]
Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg
attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union
joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition. [386] While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is
often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's
reluctance to employ women in the labour force, [387] Allied strategic bombing, [388] and Germany's late shift to a war
economy [389] contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war,
and were not equipped to do so. [390] To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave
labourers; [391] Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, [367] while Japan used more than
18 million people in Far East Asia. [374][375]

Aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-
support, and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included
airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies,
equipment, and personnel); [392] and of strategic bombing (the bombing of
enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to
wage war). [393] Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences
such as radar and surface-to-air artillery. The use of the jet aircraft was
pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to
jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide. [394] Although guided
missiles were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably
target aircraft until some years after the war.
Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably
with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war,
actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the
battleship. [395][396][397] In the Atlantic, escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the
effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap. [398] Carriers were also more economical than
battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft [399] and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured. [400]
Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War, [401] were anticipated by all sides
to be important in the second. The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar
and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII
submarine and wolfpack tactics. [402] Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the Leigh light, hedgehog,
squid, and homing torpedoes proved victorious over the German submarines.
Land warfare changed from the static front lines of trench warfare of World
War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of
both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms. The tank,
which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World
War, had evolved into the primary weapon. [403] In the late 1930s, tank design
was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I, [404]
and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour
and firepower. At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks
should be met by tanks with superior specifications. [405] This idea was
challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns
against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat.
This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key
elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and
France. [403] Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-
tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry
antitank weapons, and other tanks were used. [405] Even with large-scale
mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, [406] and
throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I. [407] The portable machine gun spread, a
notable example being the German MG34, and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban
and jungle settings. [407] The assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and

submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces. [408]
Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and
security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing
ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma
machine. [409] Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and
cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable
examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes [410] and
British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from
information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau,
which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. [411]
Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the
Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard.
[410][412]
Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of,
the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus,
and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons,
operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel. Penicillin
was first mass-produced and used during the war (see Stabilization and mass production of penicillin). [413]

giving in to U.S. pressure."

164. Dower 1986, p. 5, calls attention to the fact that "the
Allied struggle against Japan exposed the racist
underpinnings of the European and American
colonial structure. Japan did not invade independent
countries in southern Asia. It invaded colonial
outposts which the Westerners had dominated for
generations, taking absolutely for granted their racial
and cultural superiority over their Asian subjects."
Dower goes on to note that, before the horrors of
Japanese occupation made themselves felt, many
Asians responded favourably to the victories of the
Imperial Japanese forces.

the homeland was highly unlikely to succeed. The
key military factor causing this effect was the sea
blockade, which crippled Japan's ability to produce
and equip the forces necessary to execute its
strategy. The most important factor accounting for the
timing of surrender was the Soviet attack against
Manchuria, largely because it persuaded previously
adamant Army leaders that the homeland could not

Wikipedia (/?w?k?'pi?di?/ ( listen) wik-ih- PEE -dee-? or
/?w?ki'pi?di?/ ( listen) wik-ee- PEE -dee-?) is a multilingual
online encyclopedia created and maintained as an open
collaboration project [3] by a community of volunteer editors
using a wiki-based editing system. [4] It is the largest and most
popular general reference work on the World Wide Web, [5]
[6][7] and is one of the most popular websites ranked by Alexa
as of October 2019. [8] It features exclusively free content and
no commercial ads, and is owned and supported by the
Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization funded
primarily through donations. [9][10][11][12]
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy
Wales and Larry Sanger. [13] Sanger coined its name, [14][15] as
a portmanteau of "wiki" (the Hawaiian word for "quick" [16] )
and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language
encyclopedia, versions of Wikipedia in other languages were
quickly developed. With at least 5,976,564 articles, [note 3] the
English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290
Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more
than 40 million articles in 301 different languages [17] and by
February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly
500 million unique visitors per month. [18]
In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard
science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia
and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that
of Britannica, [19] although critics suggested that it might not
have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of
all articles or one focused on social science or contentious
social issues. [20][21] The following year, Time magazine stated
that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made
Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in
the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy
Wales. [22]
Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for
presenting a mixture of "truth, half truth, and some
falsehoods", [23] and for being subject to manipulation and
spin in controversial topics. [24] In addition, Wikipedia has

Other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before Wikipedia,
but none were as successful. [28] Wikipedia began as a complementary
project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project
whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal
process. [29] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of
Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy
Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.
[30][31] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content
License, but even before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the
GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman. [32]
Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable
encyclopedia, [33][34] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a
wiki to reach that goal. [35] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the
Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia. [36]
The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001 [37] and January 13, 2001 [38]

respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, [29] as a single English-language edition at
www.wikipedia.com, [39] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. [33] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-
of-view" [40] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia
operated independently of Nupedia. [33] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit. [41]
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and
web search engine indexing. Language editions were also created, with a
total of 161 by the end of 2004. [42] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until
the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was
incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of
two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest
encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia,
which had held the record for almost 600 years. [43]
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia,
users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the
Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002. [44] These moves encouraged Wales to
announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change
Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org. [45] Brion Vibber
applied the change on August 15, 2002. [46]
Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the
numbers of new articles and of contributors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. [47] Around 1,800 articles were
added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. [48] A team at the Palo Alto Research
Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change. [49] Others
suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called "low-hanging fruit"—topics that
clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively. [50][51][52]
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in
Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during
the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900
editors during the same period in 2008. [53][54] The Wall Street Journal
cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such
content among the reasons for this trend. [55] Wales disputed these claims
in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the
study. [56] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a
slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in
June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, Wales also
claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable". [57] A 2013
article titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" in MIT's Technology Review
questioned this claim. The article revealed that since 2007, Wikipedia had
lost a third of its volunteer editors, and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae. [58] In July 2012, The
Atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline. [59] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York
magazine, Katherine Ward stated "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis". [60]

In January 2007, Wikipedia entered for the first time the top-ten list of the most popular websites in the US, according
to comScore Networks. With 42.9 million unique visitors, Wikipedia was ranked number 9, surpassing The New York
Times (#10) and Apple (#11). This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when the rank was number 33,
with Wikipedia receiving around 18.3 million unique visitors. [61] As of September 2019, Wikipedia has rank 9 [8] among
websites in terms of popularity according to Alexa Internet. In 2014, it received 8 billion pageviews every month. [62]
On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia has 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million
unique visitors a month, "according to the ratings firm comScore." [18]
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of
coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States
Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act
(PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours. [63] More than 162 million
people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced
Wikipedia content. [64][65]
Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long
tradition of historical encyclopedias that accumulated improvements
piecemeal through "stigmergic accumulation". [66][67]
On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's
growth stalled, but that it "had lost nearly 10 per cent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2 billion
between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English
Wikipedia declined by 12 per cent, those of German version slid by 17 per cent and the Japanese version lost 9 per
cent." [68] Varma added that, "While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other
experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users." [68]
When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's
Berkman Center for Internet & Society indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to
Knowledge Graphs, stating, "If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any
further]." [68]
By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked fifth in the most popular websites globally. [69]
In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia; in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored
with the Wikipedia Monument; and, in July 2015, Wikipedia became available as 7,473 books for $500,000. In 2019, a
species of flowering plant was named Viola wikipedia. [70]
In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all
of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. [71][72]
In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia have been encoded into
synthetic DNA. [73]
On November 17, 2019, Christina Koch made the first confirmed edit to Wikipedia from space while aboard the
International Space Station. [74]

Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the
procrastination principle [note 4][77] regarding the security of its
content. [77] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create
articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader,
even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to
all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article
could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and
nonsensical or irrelevant text.
Due to the increasing popularity of Wikipedia, some editions,
including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions in
some cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other
language editions, only registered users may create a new article. [78]
On the English Wikipedia, among others, some particularly
controversial, sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages have been
protected to some degree. [79][80] A frequently vandalized article can
be semi-protected or extended confirmed protected, meaning that
only autoconfirmed or extended confirmed editors are able to
modify it. [81] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that
only administrators are able to make changes. [82]
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but
review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions.
For example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of
articles, [83] which have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials
and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the "pending
changes" system in December 2012. [84] Under this system, new and
unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone
articles are reviewed by established users before they are published. [85]
Although changes are not
systematically reviewed, the
software that powers Wikipedia
provides certain tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others.
The "History" page of each article links to each revision. [note 5][86] On most
articles, anyone can undo others' changes by clicking a link on the article's
history page. Anyone can view the latest changes to articles, and anyone may maintain a "watchlist" of articles that
interest them so they can be notified of any changes. "New pages patrol" is a process whereby newly created articles are
checked for obvious problems. [87]

In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create
a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor
"creative construction" over "creative destruction". [88]
Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is
considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude
humor. Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam. [89] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by
removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition
of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant
formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an
article, or use images disruptively. [90]
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the
median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes. [91][92] However,
some vandalism takes much longer to repair. [93]
In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced
false information into the biography of American political figure John
Seigenthaler in May 2005. Seigenthaler was falsely presented as a suspect
in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. [93] The article remained
uncorrected for four months. [93] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial
director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First
Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder
Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who
contributed the misinformation. Wales replied that he did not, although the
perpetrator was eventually traced. [94][95] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as "a flawed and
irresponsible research tool". [93] This incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia, specifically targeted at tightening up
the verifiability of biographical articles of living people. [96]
Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an
article, known as "edit warring". [97][98] The process is a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is
added. [99] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive, [100] conflict based [101] editing culture associated
with traditional masculine gender roles, [102] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.
Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests. Defending Israeli settlements
in the West Bank, numerous pro-occupation groups have launched "Zionist editing" campaigns. [103] In 2010, the then
director general of the Yesha Council and former Israeli Cabinet Minister Naftali Bennett described their goal "as not
to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to include our point of view". [104]

Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws)
of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of
Wikipedia's servers are located. Beyond legal matters, the editorial
principles of Wikipedia are embodied in the "five pillars" and in numerous
policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. Even
these rules are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise
the website's policies and guidelines. [105] Editors can enforce these rules
by deleting or modifying non-compliant material. Originally, rules on the
non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules
for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent. [83]
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia, each entry in Wikipedia
must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or
dictionary-like. [106] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of
"notability", [107] which generally means that the topic must have been
covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are
independent of the article's subject. Further, Wikipedia intends to convey
only knowledge that is already established and recognized. [108] It must not
present original research. A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source. Among
Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as "verifiability, not truth" to express the idea that the readers, not the
encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own
interpretations. [109] This can at times lead to the removal of information that, though valid, is not properly
sourced. [110] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides. [111] All opinions and viewpoints, if attributable to external sources,
must enjoy an appropriate share of coverage within an article. This is known as neutral point of view (NPOV).
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time. [112][113] An article is not
considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article. [114]
Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with
"administrator", [115][116] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of
vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing.
Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their
powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors,
and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).
[117][118]
Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia
administrators has become more rigorous. [119]

Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order
to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, [note 6] or seek outside
input through third opinion requests or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a "request for
comment".
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from
a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly
refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee
ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, [120] functioning not so much to
resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing
potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles,
although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for
example, if the new content is considered biased). Its remedies include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases)
and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia
are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior. When conduct is not impersonation or
anti-social, but rather anti-consensus or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings. [121]
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated "Talk" page.
These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss,
coordinate and debate. [122]
Wikipedia's community has been described as cult-like, [123] although not
always with entirely negative connotations. [124] The project's preference for
cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of
credentials, has been referred to as "anti-elitism". [125]
Wikipedians sometimes award one another virtual barnstars for good work.
These personalized tokens of appreciation reveal a wide range of valued
work extending far beyond simple editing to include social support,
administrative actions, and types of articulation work. [126]
Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide
identification. [127] As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became
one of the questions frequently asked on the project. [128] Jimmy Wales
once argued that only "a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred
volunteers" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like any traditional
organization". [129] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: "According to researchers in Palo Alto, 1 percent of
Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits." [130] This method of evaluating contributions was
later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content
(measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. [131]

The English Wikipedia has 5,976,564 articles, 37,739,867 registered
editors, and 136,186 active editors. An editor is considered active if they
have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.
Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing
talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia
outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or
discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-
trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific
technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution
process, and learn a "baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider
references". [132] Editors who do not log in are in some sense second-class
citizens on Wikipedia, [132] as "participants are accredited by members of
the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their
ongoing participation", [133] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their
IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that "anonymous and infrequent contributors to
Wikipedia [...] are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site". [134] Jimmy Wales
stated in 2009 that "(I)t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users... 524 people... And in fact
the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits." [129] However, Business Insider editor and
journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most content in Wikipedia (measured by
the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by "outsiders", while most editing
and formatting is done by "insiders". [129]
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, [135][136] although a
later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences
with the control group and the samples were small. [137] According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing
resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content". [138]
Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia
Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. [139] Because of this,
universities throughout the United States tried to encourage females to become Wikipedia contributors. Similarly,
many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article
relating to women in science or technology. [140] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, wrote in The New York Times
that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was
because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to "ugly, intimidating behavior." [141] Data has shown that Africans
are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors. [142]

December 2019, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, Swedish, German, French, and
Dutch Wikipedias. [143] The second and third largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot,
which as of 2013 had created about half the articles in the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano
and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.
In addition to the top six, ten other Wikipedias have over one million articles each (Russian, Italian, Spanish, Polish,
Waray-Waray, Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic and Portuguese), six more have over 500,000 articles
(Ukrainian, Persian, Catalan, Serbian, Bokmål and Indonesian), 40 more have over 100,000 articles, and 84 more
have over 10,000 articles. [144][145] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 5.9 million articles. As of January 2019,
according to Alexa, the English subdomain (en.wikipedia.org; English Wikipedia) receives approximately 57% of
Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages (Russian: 9%; Chinese: 6%;
Japanese: 6%; Spanish: 5%). [8]

Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use
different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may
lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color) [148] or points of view. [149]

Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as
"neutral point of view", they diverge on some points of policy and practice,
most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under
a claim of fair use. [150][151][152]
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a
free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the
planet in their own language". [153] Though each language edition functions
more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They
are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki
devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others). [154] For
instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of
Wikipedia, [155] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should
have. [156] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history,
geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not
rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have
counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the
United States might be available only in English, even when they meet
notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions,
in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of
articles. [157] Articles available in more than one language may offer "interwiki
links", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.
A study published by PLoS ONE in 2012 also estimated the share of
contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the
world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America
was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English
Wikipedia. [158] The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of
editors in the Global South to 37% by 2015. [159]
On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled "The Future of
Wikipedia", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by Wikimedia
stating that "[t]he number of editors for the English-language version has
fallen by a third in seven years." [160] The attrition rate for active editors in
English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast
to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The
Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five
or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia
in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal
variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors
in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at
approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.

effectively ameliorating substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia. [161]
Several Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes over 50 policies and
nearly 150,000 words as of 2014. [162][163]
Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black criticized
Wikipedia for being a mixture of "truth, half truth, and some falsehoods". [23] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher
Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's Undue Weight policy, concluding
that the fact that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus
on all the major viewpoints on the subject and give less attention to minor ones, creates omissions that can lead to false
beliefs based on incomplete information. [164][165][166]
Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black noted (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) how articles are dominated by the
loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an "ax to grind" on the topic. [23][167] A 2008 article in
Education Next Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation
and spin. [24]
In 2006, the Wikipedia Watch criticism website listed dozens of examples of plagiarism in the English Wikipedia. [168]

2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia
Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in
accuracy, and concluded that "the average science entry in Wikipedia
contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three." [19] Reagle
suggested that while the study reflects "a topical strength of Wikipedia
contributors" in science articles, "Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on
humanities subjects." [20] Others raised similar critiques. [21] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia
Britannica, [170][171] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica. [172] In addition to the
point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method
used in the Nature effort, and suggested a "flawed study design" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in
whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study
"statistical power" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 10 1 articles compared, vs >10 5 and >10 6 set sizes for
Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively). [173]
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia "makes no guarantee of validity" of its content, since no one is
ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. [174] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding
the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, [175] the insertion of false information, [176] vandalism, and
similar problems.
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on
economics was more likely to be true, after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that some
traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in
journal articles and relevant information is omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are
frequently found on Internet sites, and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. [177]
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it
unreliable. [178] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article
is not clear. [179] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the
project's utility and status as an encyclopedia. [180] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has
largely avoided the problem of "fake news" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources
in articles. [181]
Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet
trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as
counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online
encyclopedia. [86][183] In response to paid advocacy editing and
undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The
Wall Street Journal, to have strengthened its rules and laws against
undisclosed editing. [184] The article stated that: "Beginning Monday [from
the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use
will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia
Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're
not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'" [184][185][186][187][188] These issues, among others, had been
parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report. [189]
A Harvard law textbook, Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a "general source" that "can be a real
Wikipedia - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia

boon" in "coming up to speed in the law governing a situation" and, "while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as
well as leads to more in-depth resources". [190]
Most university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary
sources; [191] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. [192][193] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are
not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. [194] Wales once (2006
or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they
cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. "For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the
encyclopedia," he said. [195]
In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard
University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change. [196]
In June 2007, former president of the American Library Association Michael Gorman condemned Wikipedia, along
with Google, [197] stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are "the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian
who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything".
On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled "Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare
Information: Wikipedia", stated that "Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some
are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information." [198] Beck continued to detail in this
article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical
students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control
programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central
medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer
review evaluation process. [198] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled "Can Wikipedia Ever Be a
Definitive Medical Text?", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: "Just because a
reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference." [199] Beck added that: "Wikipedia has its own
peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured.' Heilman, who has participated in that
process before, says 'less than 1 percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed." [199]
In 2008, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that the quality
of a Wikipedia article would suffer rather than gain from adding more
writers when the article lacked appropriate explicit or implicit
coordination. [201] For instance, when contributors rewrite small portions of
an entry rather than making full-length revisions, high- and low-quality
content may be intermingled within an entry. Roy Rosenzweig, a history
professor, stated that American National Biography Online outperformed
Wikipedia in terms of its "clear and engaging prose", which, he said, was an
important aspect of good historical writing. [202] Contrasting Wikipedia's

McPherson in American National Biography Online, he said that both were essentially accurate and covered the major
episodes in Lincoln's life, but praised "McPherson's richer contextualization [...] his artful use of quotations to capture
Lincoln's voice [...] and [...] his ability to convey a profound message in a handful of words." By contrast, he gives an
example of Wikipedia's prose that he finds "both verbose and dull". Rosenzweig also criticized the "waffling
—encouraged by the NPOV policy—[which] means that it is hard to discern any overall interpretive stance in Wikipedia
history". While generally praising the article on William Clarke Quantrill, he quoted its conclusion as an example of
such "waffling", which then stated: "Some historians [...] remember him as an opportunistic, bloodthirsty outlaw, while
others continue to view him as a daring soldier and local folk hero." [202]
Other critics have made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia articles are factually accurate, they are often written in
a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented, "Even when a Wikipedia
entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads as if it has been
translated from one language to another then into a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage." [203] A study of
Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas
Jefferson University. The study was limited to those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and
excluded those written at the "start" class or "stub" class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very
readable, and thought that "Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and
haphazard editing". [204] The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: "inelegant or
ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information". [205]
To assess Wikipedia articles various quality measures related to credibility, completeness, objectivity, readability,
relevance, style and timeliness can be used. [206]
Wikipedia seeks to create a
summary of all human
knowledge in the form of an
online encyclopedia, with
each topic covered
encyclopedically in one
article. Since it has
terabytes of disk space, it
can have far more topics
than can be covered by any
printed encyclopedia. [207]
The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are
not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism). [208][209] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find
objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. The 'Wikipedia is not censored' policy has sometimes proved controversial:
in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of
its Muhammad article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive
materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China [210] and Pakistan, [211]
amongst other countries.
A 2008 study conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and Palo Alto Research Center gave a
distribution of topics as well as growth (from July 2006 to January 2008) in each field: [212]

These numbers refer only to the quantity of articles: it is possible for one topic to contain a large number of short
articles and another to contain a small number of large ones. Through its "Wikipedia Loves Libraries" program,
Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to
expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. [213]
A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on
different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the People and Arts category, while males
focus more on Geography and Science. [214]
Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic
distribution of article topics is highly uneven. Africa is most underrepresented. [215] Across 30 language editions of
Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events. [216]
An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn
actors than a list of women writers. [217] Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a
knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address. [142]
When multiple editors contribute to one topic or set of topics, systemic bias may arise, due to the demographic
backgrounds of the editors. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography
of the editors, citing for example "biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early
childcare". [57] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled "The Decline of
Wikipedia" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors. [58]
Systemic bias on Wikipedia may follow that of culture generally, for example favoring certain nationalities, ethnicities

or majority religions. [218] It may more specifically follow the biases of Internet culture, inclining to being young, male,
English-speaking, educated, technologically aware, and wealthy enough to spare time for editing. Biases of its own may
include over-emphasis on topics such as pop culture, technology, and current events. [218]
Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford, in 2013, studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia
introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution. [219][220] His research examined the counterproductive work
behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant
measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting
"reverting/reverted pairs" or "mutually reverting edit pairs". Such a "mutually reverting edit pair" is defined where one
editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the "mutually
reverting edit pairs". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's
three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism and Muhammad. [220] By comparison,
for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the Oxford study were for the articles covering
(i) Croatia, (ii) Scientology and (iii) 9/11 conspiracy theories. [220]
Researchers from Washington University developed a statistical model to measure systematic bias in the behavior of
Wikipedia's users regarding controversial topics. The authors focused on behavioral changes of the encyclopedia's
administrators after assuming the post, writing that systematic bias occurred after the fact. [221][222]
Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information of graphic content. Articles depicting what some critics have
called objectionable content (such as Feces, Cadaver, Human penis, Vulva, and Nudity) contain graphic pictures and
detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.
The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of
zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude
children.
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from German heavy metal band Scorpions—features a picture
of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy
and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for
four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF)
decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a "blacklist" it supplies
to British internet service providers. [223]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of
images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity
law. [224][225] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of
real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the
PROTECT Act of 2003. [226] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of
children that are obscene under American law. [226] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on
Wikipedia in schools. [227] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, [228]
saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it." [228]
Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors
who volunteer to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up

some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the
Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was "in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real
philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted". [229] Critics, including Wikipediocracy,
noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. [230]
One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a "private citizen" rather than a
"public figure" in the eyes of the law. [231][note 7] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the
right to be anonymous in real life ("meatspace"). A particular problem occurs in the case of an individual who is
relatively unimportant and for whom there exists a Wikipedia page against her or his wishes.
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full
name of Boris Floricic, aka "Tron", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia
Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was
being violated. [232]
Wikipedia has a "Volunteer Response Team" that uses the OTRS system to handle queries without having to reveal the
identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images
and other media in the project. [233]
Wikipedia has been described as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment. [234][235] The perceived
toxic attitudes and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap in Wikipedia
editors. [236] In 2014, a female editor who requested a separate space on Wikipedia to discuss improving civility had her
proposal referred to by a male editor using the words "the easiest way to avoid being called a cunt is not to act like
one". [234]
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit
organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as
Wiktionary and Wikibooks. The foundation relies on public contributions
and grants to fund its mission. [237] The foundation's 2013 IRS Form 990
shows revenue of $39.7 million and expenses of almost $29 million, with
assets of $37.2 million and liabilities of about $2.3 million. [238]
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second
executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. [239] The Wall Street
Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology
background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an
opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often

repeated position statement that, "Information, like air, wants to be free." [240][241] The same Wall Street Journal
article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia,
who "said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more
transparency... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of
contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more
tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities, Walsh said." [240]
Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the "superprotection" feature
which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, Katherine Maher became the third executive director the
Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016. [242] Maher has stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor
harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. Maher stated regarding the
harassment issue that: "It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority... (and that correction
requires that) it has to be more than words." [243]
Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but
independently run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or
sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimédia France), thematic organizations (such as
Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the
promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.
The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform
written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system. [244] The software incorporates programming features such
as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under
the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.
Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required
CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002
(Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for
Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially
increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally
written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed [245] to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.
In April 2005, a Lucene extension [246][247] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from
MySQL to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1, [248] which is written in Java and based on
Lucene library 2.3. [249]
In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was
opened to public use. [250][251][252][253] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and
buggy". [254] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.
Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting
common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from
Software operations and support

statistical data. [255][256][257] One controversial contributor creating articles with his bot was reported to create up to
10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. [258] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically
notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses). [259]
Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is
programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly. [256] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP
address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was
reported edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government. [260] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved
before activation. [261]
According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision
without the use of such bots. [262]
Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000 page requests per second, depending on time of day. [263] As of 2019,
page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers. [264] Further statistics, based on a publicly
available 3-month Wikipedia access trace, are available. [265] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache
are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the
Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing
page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a
distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page
accesses.
Overview of system architecture as
of October 2015
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers (mainly Ubuntu). [266][267] As of December 2009, there
were 300 in Florida and 44 in Amsterdam. [268] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center
to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia. [269][270] in 2017, Wikipedia had installed a caching cluster in an Equinix
facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia. [271]

Internal research and operational development

In accordance with growing amounts of incoming donations exceeding seven digits in 2013 as recently reported, [58] the
Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial
organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and
development of the Foundation. [272] Two of the recent projects of such internal research and development have been
the creation of a Visual Editor and a largely under-utilized "Thank" tab which were developed for the purpose of
ameliorating issues of editor attrition, which have met with limited success. [58][254] The estimates for reinvestment by
industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the
range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high end technology requiring the higher level of support
for internal reinvestment. [273] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million
dollars, the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe and Caballero for reinvestment into internal research and
development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually. [273] In 2016, the level of contributions were
reported by Bloomberg News as being at $77 million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of
support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually. [273]
Community-produced news publications include the English Wikipedia's The Signpost, founded in 2005 by Michael
Snow, an attorney, Wikipedia administrator and former chair of the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees. [274] It
covers news and events from the site, as well as major events from other Wikimedia projects, such as Wikimedia
Commons. Similar publications are the German-language Kurier, and the Portuguese-language Correio da Wikipédia.
Other past and present community news publications on English Wikipedia include the "Wikiworld" web comic, the
Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History
and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are also a number of publications from the
Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog (https://blog.wikimedia.org/) and
This Month in Education.
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License
(GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content
while authors retain copyright of their work. [275] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free
software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the
GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002,
the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for
software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web.
The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. [276] Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative
Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation
(FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA
by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia
and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009. [277][278][279][280]
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the
English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part
Internal news publications

because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by
free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons
repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international
copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the
quality of the encyclopedic text. [281]
The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and
licensors) of the Wikipedia. This position has been successfully defended in court. [282][283]
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. The
content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside of the Wikipedia website.
Websites – Thousands of "mirror sites" exist that republish content from Wikipedia: two prominent ones, that also
include content from other reference sources, are Reference.com and Answers.com. Another example is
Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.
Mobile apps – A variety of mobile apps provide access to Wikipedia on hand-held devices, including both Android
and iOS devices (see Wikipedia apps). (See also Mobile access.)
Search engines – Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search
results: examples include Bing (via technology gained from Powerset) [284] and DuckDuckGo.
Compact discs, DVDs – Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English
version, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, contained about 2,000 articles. [285][286] The Polish-language version
contains nearly 240,000 articles. [287] There are German- and Spanish-language versions as well. [288][289] Also,
"Wikipedia for Schools", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedians and SOS Children, is a
free, hand-checked, non-commercial selection from Wikipedia targeted around the UK National Curriculum and
intended to be useful for much of the English-speaking world. [290] The project is available online; an equivalent
print encyclopedia would require roughly 20 volumes.
Printed books – There are efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form. [291][292]
Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian and French
Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries
of the German publisher VDM. [293]
Semantic Web – The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category
declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar
objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and the other WMF wikis and make it available in
a queriable semantic format, RDF. This is still under development. As of February 2014 it has 15,000,000 items
and 1,000 properties for describing them.
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is
discouraged. [294] Wikipedia publishes "dumps" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2007 there was no dump
available of Wikipedia's images. [295]
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general
public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference
desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent. [296]
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed
Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The
New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that
the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. [18]
Methods of access

The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for
mobile edits stating that, "Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-
language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower
than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which
approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even
more." [18] The New York Times reports that Möller has assigned "a team of
10 software developers focused on mobile", out of a total of approximately
200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal
concern cited by The New York Times for the "worry" is for Wikipedia to
effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the
online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile
access environment. [18]
Bloomberg Businessweek reported in July 2014 that Google's Android
mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone
shipments for 2013 with 78.6% of market share over their next closest
competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market. [297] At the time of the Tretikov
appointment and her posted web interview with Sue Gardner in May 2014,
Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the
number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to
Wikipedia. Directly after the posted web interview, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-
inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general
mobile access, including BlackBerry and the Windows Phone system, making market share a secondary issue. [241] The
latest version of the Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to generally positive reviews, scoring
over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. [298] The latest version
for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. [299]
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol
(WAP), via the Wapedia service. In June 2007 Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org (https://web.archive.org/
web/20090112031222/http://en.mobile.wikipedia.org/), an official website for wireless devices. In 2009 a newer
mobile service was officially released, [300] located at en.m.wikipedia.org (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/), which caters to
more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices or WebOS-based devices. Several other
methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display
of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia
metadata (See Wikipedia:Metadata), such as geoinformation. [301][302]
Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the
developing countries. [303] It was discontinued in February 2018. [304]
Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smart phones is difficult and this discourages
new potential contributors. Several years running the number of Wikipedia editors has been falling and Tom Simonite
of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some
Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in
keeping the status quo. [58] Lih alleges there is serious disagreement among existing contributors how to resolve this.
Lih fears for Wikipedia's long term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival
encyclopedias will not replace it. [305][306]

In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on
Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news. Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post
states, "YouTube’s reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged
platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake
news'." [27] In answer to the question of 'how engaged are visitors to the site?' Alexa records the daily pageviews per
visitor as 3.04 and the daily time on site as 4.01 minutes. [8]
In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia is ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating
"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month [...] Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook,
Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors." [18]
In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles, [307] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general
reference website since its inception in 2001. [308] About 50 percent of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from
Google, [309] a good portion of which is related to academic research. [310] The number of readers of Wikipedia
worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009. [311] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one
third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. [312] In 2011 Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if
it ran advertisements. [313]
According to "Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity
between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of
readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize
that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. [314]
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books,
conferences, and court cases. [315][316][317] The Parliament of Canada's
website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the "related
links" section of its "further reading" list for the Civil Marriage Act. [318]
The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by
organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual
Property Organization [319] —though mainly for supporting information
rather than information decisive to a case. [320] Content appearing on
Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US
intelligence agency reports. [321] In December 2008, the scientific journal
RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA
molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit
a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia. [322]

Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, [323][324] often without attribution, and several reporters have
been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia. [325][326][327]
In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and
Facebook [328] ) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.
In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4 [329] which argued that, with
increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the word is one
of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar (Google, Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need
explanation.
On September 28, 2007, Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural
resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced
Wikipedia, "the seventh most consulted website", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed
this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues. [330]
On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had
become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: "Type a
candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia
page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a
candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and
debated countless times each day." [331] An October 2007 Reuters article,
titled "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol", reported the recent
phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's
notability. [332]
Active participation also has an impact. Law students have been assigned to
write Wikipedia articles as an exercise in clear and succinct writing for an
uninitiated audience. [333]
A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based
project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report
called Wikipedia "the best-known example of crowdsourcing... that far
exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias
and dictionaries, in scale and depth." [334]
In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes
Wikipedia as "one of the last remaining pillars of the open and
decentralized web" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of
knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter
having "since colonized the web for television's values." For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia
represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers
"endangered" due to the "gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift
from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment." Rather than "sapere aude" (lit.?'dare to know'), social
networks have led to a culture of "[d]are not to care to know." This is while Wikipedia faces "a more concerning
problem" than funding, namely "a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website." Consequently,
the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to "save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of

all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when
nobody cares to know." [335]
Wikipedia won two major awards in May 2004. [336] The first was a Golden
Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest;
this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to
present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second
was a Judges' Webby Award for the "community" category. [337] Wikipedia
was also nominated for a "Best Practices" Webby award.
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-
highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the
question "Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?" [338]
In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of
Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadic,
Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by
David Weinberger. [339]
In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which
recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social
sciences, [340] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International
Cooperation. [341] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city
that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the
Asturian language Wikipedia users. [342] The night of the ceremony,
members of the Wikimedia Foundation held a meeting with Wikipedians
from all parts of Spain, including the local Asturian community.
Many parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or
modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert
Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning "together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the
reality we just agreed on". [189] Another example can be found in "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American
Independence", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion, [343] as well as the 2010 The Onion article "'L.A. Law'
Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today". [344]
In an episode of the television comedy The Office U.S., which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager
(Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics in order to
assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. [345] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the
page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the
article's talk page. [346]

unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Dr. Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article
indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that
article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide. [347]
In 2008, the comedic website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named "Professor Wikipedia", in which the
fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. [348]
The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying "Give me ten
minutes and then check Wikipedia." [349]
In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody
of Wikipedia. Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles. [350]
In 2010, comedian Daniel Tosh encouraged viewers of his show, Tosh.0, to visit the show's Wikipedia article and edit it
at will. On a later episode, he commented on the edits to the article, most of them offensive, which had been made by
the audience and had prompted the article to be locked from editing. [351][352]
On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: "Dammit, Manning, have you
considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?" [353] The cartoon referred to Chelsea
Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army
soldier and a trans woman.
In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as an historian he
resorted to Wikipedia "at least a dozen times a day", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as "a work of
reference as useful as any in existence", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place or thing
that it has left uncovered, and that he could never have written his last two books without it. [354][355]
Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other
Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002, [356] Wikiquote, a collection
of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free
textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews, for
citizen journalism, and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online
learning activities. [357] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalogue of species. In 2012 Wikivoyage,
an editable travel guide, and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially the printed
versions, e.g. Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. [358]
[359][360]
Nicholas Carr wrote a 2005 essay, "The amorality of Web 2.0", that criticized websites with user-generated
content, like Wikipedia, for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of
business, because "free trumps quality all the time". Carr wrote: "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the
hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening." [361] Others dispute the notion that
Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. For instance, Chris Anderson, the editor-in-
chief of Wired Magazine, wrote in Nature that the "wisdom of crowds" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top

scientific journals, with their rigorous peer review process. [362]
There is also an ongoing debate about the influence of Wikipedia on the
biography publishing business. "The worry is that, if you can get all that
information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?" said Kathryn
Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author
of The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton and George Eliot: the Last
Victorian. [363]
Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in
computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language
processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for
the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification", [364] and to
the related problem of word sense disambiguation. [365] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find
"missing" links in Wikipedia. [366]
In 2015, French researchers Dr José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of
Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.
[367][368][369] They used PageRank "followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of
Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)." [369]
A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications. [370][371]
A 2018 Charles University study concluded that Wikipedia is the most used OER for students of environmental studies
(used by 95% of students) and argued that educational institutions should focus their attention on it (for example by
supporting Wikipedians in residence). [372]
Studies related to Wikipedia has been using machine learning and artificial intelligence to support various operations.
One of the most important areas—automatic detection of vandalism [373][374] and data quality assessment in
Wikipedia, [375] which may include different measures for articles and infoboxes. [206]
A number of interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before
Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC
Micro computers) and photographs from over 1 million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and
culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia
document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map
of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until
2008. [376]
Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g.
Everything2), [377] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE). [378] One of the most successful early
online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The
h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively light-hearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.

Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as Susning.nu,
Enciclopedia Libre, Hudong, and Baidu Baike likewise employ no formal review process, although some like
Conservapedia are not as open. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online
wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable
alternative to Wikipedia. [379][380]

004/12/30/142458/25). Kuro5hin, Op–Ed. "There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups
[...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on
you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish
behavior, the other listmembers will cry "censorship", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...]
The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both
of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for
expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not
accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a
policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the
policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very
hard.)"
