Exercise 2.2. Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
delimiter = '.'
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of
the expression).
1. width/2 --> Python 2.7 8 / Python 3.7 8.5
2. width/2.0 -> 8.5
3. height/3 -> 4.0
4. 1 + 2 * 5 -> 11
5. delimiter * 5 -> .....
