Imagine you work at the admission office of some university, and you need to select successful applications for the next academic year.

All candidates took entry exams in Maths, Physics, and English. Results are stored in the lists scores_maths, scores_physics and scores_english respectively.

To enter the university, a student must get at least 270 points in total.

How many students will be admitted?
