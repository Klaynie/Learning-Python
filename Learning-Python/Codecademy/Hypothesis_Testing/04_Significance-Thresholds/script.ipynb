For example, suppose that we are developing a new quiz question at Codecademy and want learners to have a 70% chance of getting the question right (higher would mean the question is too easy, lower would mean the question is too hard). We show our quiz question to a sample of 100 learners and 60 of them get it right. Is this significantly different from our target of 70%? If so, we want to remove the question and try to rewrite it.\r\n",

P-values that are less than this threshold are considered \"significant\", while larger p-values are considered \"not significant\"."

    "Excellent work! In this lesson you have:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* Learned to interpret a p-value using a significance threshold\r\n",
    "* Explored type I and type II errors in hypothesis testing\r\n",

    "In the workspace, we have borrowed a comic strip from xkcd that describes (with a little humor!) the problem of multiple hypothesis tests. The initial question asked in the comic is whether or not there is a link between jelly beans and acne. At first, scientists find no link — but then they run 20 more hypothesis tests looking for a link between specific colors of jelly beans and acne. One of those tests results in a significant p-value — and the final panel of the comic shows that this one test is the only test that gets published. The comic perfectly describes how running multiple hypothesis tests and only reporting significant results is extremely problematic. This has contributed to the *reproducibility crisis* in statistics. At a .05 significance level, approximately 5% of hypothesis tests will result in a false positive; but if we only report those false positives, we end up with a lot of published results that cannot be replicated."
