    "In this lesson, we will be learning how to use Python to calculate key financial statistics for making informed decisions about investments. There are many different kinds of financial assets, or *securities*, ranging from real estate to government bonds to the common stock. But no matter the type of investment, there are two things that we always need to consider about each asset - the return and the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *rate of return* is a measure of the amount of money gained or lost in an investment. A positive return signifies a profit and a negative return indicates a loss. The *risk* of an investment is defined as the likelihood of suffering a financial loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is often a tradeoff between risk and return, where the higher the potential return of an asset, the higher the risk involved. Thus, it is important to understand both aspects for making smart choices about an investment - which we will learn to do in this lesson.\n",

    "## Simple Rate of Return\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are familiar with how the rate of return is usually expressed, let us take a look at calculating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic type of return is the **simple rate of return**. It is defined as the difference between the starting and ending price of an investment over a time period, divided by the starting price. If an investment returns dividends, those dividends should be added to the numerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R = \\frac{E - S + D}{S}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $R$: simple rate of return\n",
    "* $S$: starting price of investment\n",
    "* $E$: ending price of investment\n",
    "* $D$: dividend\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation above, the numerator represents the absolute amount gained or lost in an investment. For example, if the starting price of an investment is $\\$25$ and the ending price is $\\$30$, then there is a $\\$5$ profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this gives us some information about the return of an investment, it is by itself not very useful for comparing between investments. That is, a $\\$5$ profit from a $\\$25$ investment may be a decent gain, but the same $\\$5$ profit from a $\\$10,000$ investment would be trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the simple rate of return is calculated as the absolute gain or loss divided by the starting price of the investment. By expressing the return as a percentage of the originally invested amount, we can more easily compare across different investments."
