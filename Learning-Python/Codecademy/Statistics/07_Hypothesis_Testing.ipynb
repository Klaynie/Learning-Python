    "When trying to estimate something based on sample(s) from a larger population of interest, it is important to formulate specific questions and then quantify uncertainty about the answers. Some situations involve numerical data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a professor expects an exam average to be roughly 75%, and wants to know if the actual scores line up with this expectation. Was the test actually too easy or too hard?\n",
    "* a manager of a chain of stores wants to know if certain locations have different revenues on different days of the week. Are the revenue differences a result of natural fluctuations or a significant difference between the stores' sales patterns?\n",
    "* a PM for a website wants to compare the time spent on different versions of a homepage. Does one version make users stay on the page significantly longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Others involve categorical data, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a pollster wants to know if men and women have significantly different yogurt flavor preferences. Does a result where men more often answer \"chocolate\" as their favorite reflect a significant difference in the population?\n",
    "* do different age groups have significantly different emotional reactions to different ads?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how about how we can use hypothesis testing to help answer these questions. There are several different types of hypothesis tests for the various scenarios you may encounter. Luckily, SciPy has built-in functions that perform all of these tests for us, normally using just one line of code.\n",

Suppose that a product manager wants online BuyPie orders to cost around 1000 Rupees on average. In the past day, 50 people made an online purchase and the average payment per order was only 980 Rupees. Are people really spending less than 1000 Rupees on average? Or is this just the result of chance and a small sample size?\n",

    "## Assumptions of T-Tests and ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we use one or two sample t-tests or ANOVA, we need to be sure that the following things are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The sample(s) should be normally distributed…ish\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysts in the real world often still perform t-tests or ANOVAs on data that are not normally distributed. This is usually not a problem if sample size is large, but it depends on how non-normal the data is. In general, the bigger the sample size, the safer you are!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The standard deviations of the samples should be equal\n",
    "\n",
    "For ANOVA and 2-Sample T-Tests, using datasets with standard deviations that are significantly different from each other will often obscure the differences in group means. That said, there is also a way to run a 2-Sample T-Test without assuming equal standard deviations (for example, by setting the `equal_var` parameter in the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind()` function equal to `False`). Running the test in this way has some disadvantages (it essentially makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis even when there is a true difference between groups), so it’s important to check for equal standard deviations before running a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check this assumption, it is normally sufficient to divide the two standard deviations and see if the ratio is \"close enough\" to $1$. \"Close enough\" may differ in different contexts but generally staying within $10\\%$ should suffice. This equates to a ratio between $0.9$ and $1.1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The samples must be independent\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing two or more datasets, the values in one distribution should not affect the values in another distribution. In other words, knowing more about one distribution should not give you any information about any other distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples where it would seem the samples are not independent:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the number of goals scored per soccer player before, during, and after undergoing a rigorous training regimen\n",
    "* a group of patients' blood pressure levels before, during, and after the administration of a drug\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand your datasets before you begin conducting hypothesis tests on them so that you know you are choosing the right test."

    "\n",
    "Let us imagine that we are analyzing the percentage of customers who make a purchase after visiting a website. $1000$ customers visited the site this month, and $58$ of them made a purchase. The marketing department reports that historical data suggests about $72$ of every $1000$ visitors make a purchase. Thus, they estimate that the probability of any particular customer making a purchase is $7.2\\%$. We would like to know if this month's number, $58$ purchases, is significantly different from normal or a reasonable fluctuation due to random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous exercises, we collected samples of numerical information (eg. order price) and then used the mean and standard deviation of those samples to make comparisons. In contrast, we now have a sample where each unit (a visitor) falls into one of two discrete categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"made a purchase\"\n",
    "* \"did not make a purchase\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of comparing sample means, we want to compare the percent in the \"made a purchase\" category to some expectation. This can be done with a _Binomial Test_. The binomial distribution describes the number of expected \"successes\" in an experiment with some number of \"trials\". In this case, our experiment consists of $1000$ people visiting the site. For each of those trials (visitors), we expect that there is a $7.2\\%$ chance of a purchase (success).\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy has a function called `binom_test()`, which performs a Binomial Test for you. In this example, the null hypothesis is that the true probability of a purchase is $7.2\\%$. The default alternative hypothesis for the `binom_test()` function in this example is that the true probability is not $7.2\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "`binom_test()` requires three inputs, the number of observed successes, the number of total trials, and an expected probability of success. For example, with $1000$ coin flips of a fair coin, we would expect a \"success rate\" (the rate of getting heads), to be $0.5$, and the number of trials to be $1000$. Let us imagine we get $525$ heads. Is the coin weighted? This function call would look like:\n",

If we get a p-value less than $0.05$, we can reject the null hypothesis and say it is unlikely that the true probability of heads was $0.5$ on each flip, suggesting that the coin is weighted."

If the p-value is below our chosen threshold (often $0.05$), we reject the null hypothesis and can conclude there is a statistically significant association between the two variables (eg. men, women, and non-binary people appear to have different probabilities of making a purchase, so gender is associated with purchase-status)."
