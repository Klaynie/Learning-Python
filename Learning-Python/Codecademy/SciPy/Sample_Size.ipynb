A sample size calculator tells us that we need $210$ samples. The chart shows the cumulative conversion rate after each new sample. When we reach our desired $210$ samples, our cumulative conversion rate is slightly higher than $5\\%$, but the difference is not significantly different (indicated by red). By extending the experiment to $320$ samples, the difference becomes significantly different (indicated by green). We might conclude that our results are significant if we stopped the experiment at this point. However, we can see this is a temporary fluctuation. After this brief moment of \"significance\" the conversion rate decreases and our results become insignificant again.

    "\n",
    "It is sometimes tricky to determine what the effective population size is. For example, suppose there are $200$ people who currently visit BeetsMe regularly. Is $200$ the population size for our vegetable survey?\n",
    "\n",
    "If BeetsMe wants to appeal to the tourists that frequently visit Vancucumber, or if they ever want to launch an online store to ship healthy treats all over the world, the real population size is closer to $8$ billion (or infinity, really, if we think about the number of humans who could eventually exist and have vegetable preferences). So, for experiments like this, we use the highest population size we can. Normally, $100,000$ will suffice, as changes become negligible beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, for decisions that require extrapolation to an unknown customer base, it is important to understand the preferences of a typical person out in the world, whether or not they are part of your customer base right now. Generally, we use this larger population size of $100,000$ or greater instead of focusing on the amount of current customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the small town of Vancucumber is holding an election for a new mayor, and we want to project the results of the election, _then_ the $1700$ citizens would be the only important people. In this case, $1700$ is the population size we would use in a sample size calculator."
