    "As an example, we will explore a sample of data from the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI-40), a personality test with 40 questions about personal preferences and self-view. There are two possible responses to each question. The sample we’ll be working with contains responses to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `influence`: `yes` = I have a natural talent for influencing people; `no` = I am not good at influencing people.\n",
    "* `blend_in`: `yes` = I prefer to blend in with the crowd; `no` = I like to be the center of attention.\n",
    "* `special`: `yes` = I think I am a special person; `no` = I am `no` better or worse than most people.\n",
    "* `leader`: `yes` = I see myself as a good leader; `no` = I am not sure if I would make a good leader.\n",
    "* `authority`: `yes` = I like to have authority over other people; `no` = I do not mind following orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, responses to some of these questions are associated. For example, if we know whether someone views themself as a good leader, we may also find that they are more likely to like having authority. In this lesson we will learn how to assess whether an association exists between any two of these variables."

    "In the previous exercise, we calculated a contingency table of expected frequencies **if** there were no association between the `leader` and `influence` questions. We then compared this to the observed contingency table. Because the tables looked somewhat different, we concluded that responses to these questions are probably associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can inspect these tables visually, many data scientists use the *Chi-Square* statistic to summarize *how* different these two tables are. To calculate the Chi Square statistic, we simply find the squared difference between each value in the observed table and its corresponding value in the expected table; then add up those numbers:\n",

    "The interpretation of the Chi-Square statistic is dependent on the size of the contingency table. For a 2x2 table (like the one we have been investigating), a Chi-Square statistic larger than around 4 would strongly suggest an association between the variables. In this example, our Chi-Square statistic is much larger than that — 1307.88! This adds to our evidence that the variables are highly associated."
